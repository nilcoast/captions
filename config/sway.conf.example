# Add to ~/.config/sway/config
#
# Option A: systemd service (recommended)
# The daemon runs as a systemd user service, keybind just toggles capture.
# Make sure sway exports the environment for the service:
exec systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
exec systemctl --user start captions

bindsym $mod+c exec captions toggle

# Option B: sway-managed (no systemd)
# Sway starts the daemon directly. It dies when sway exits.
# exec captions
# bindsym $mod+c exec captions toggle
